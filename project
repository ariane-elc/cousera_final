# to conclude on the first method on random forest, we find an Accuracy of 1 and Kappa : 1 which means a perfec argument. It is so perfect that it can beproblematic as the data could be overfitting 

# Method n2 : now let's try to see how accurate we are with classification tree. the method relies on classify ing the new information into one of the categories of the old data, it's a probabilistic estimate of class membership.

# Method 3 : now let's try the GBM model. The idea behind it GBMs build an ensemble of successive treesthat learnt on the previous tree, instead on building many different tree like rf.
